Model integration
-----------------

The energy demand model of the ITRC-MISTRAL framework allows 
the simulation of long-term changes in energy demand patterns
for the residential, service and industry sector on a high temporal
and spatial scale. National end-use specific energy demand data is
disaggregated on local authority district level and a bottom-up approach
is implemented for hourly energy demand estimation for different fuel types
and end-uses. 
Future energy demand is simulated based on different
socio-technical scenario assumptions such as technology efficiencies,
changes in the technological mix per end-use consumptions or behavioural change.
Energy demand is simulated in relation to changes in scenario drivers of the
base year. End-use specific socio-technical drivers for energy demands
are defined and modelled where possible on a household level.

The energy demand model integrates energy demands across
all ITRC models and provides demands to the supply model.
