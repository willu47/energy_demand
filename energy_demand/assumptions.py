The ECUK table serves as the most important national energy demand input.

[y]   Yearly variation
[h]   Shape of each hour in a day
[d]   Shape of each day in a year
[p_h] Shape of heak day in hours
[p_d] Relationship between demand of peak day and demand in a year

====================                              ==================

Carbon Trust data is for sectors and in electricity and gas

For Elec, individual shapes are used to generate shape
For gas, all gas data cross all sectors is used to generate shape
--> For enduse where both elec and gas are used, take shape of dominant fueltype and use same load shape for other fueltypes

ENDUSE
  Catering
  Computing
  Cooling and ventilation
  Hot water
  Heating
  Lighting
  Other

SECTORS                                           SHAPES

  Hospitality (aggr)
  Military (aggr)
  Storage (aggr)

  TODO: Exclude heating from electricity by contrasting winter/summer
  (excl. heating with summer/winter comparison)
  Select individual load shapes for different sectors where possible (only electricity) (excl. heating with summer/winter comparison)
  For sectors where no carbon trail data relates,use aggregated load curves from carbon trust with: Financial, Government, Manufacturing, other Sectors

SHAPES Elec
Calculate electricity shapes for aggregated and individual sectors:
    [h]    Carbon Trust Metering Trial: averaged daily profily for every month (daytype, month, h)
    [p_h]  Carbon Trust Metering Trial: maximum peak day is selected and daily load shape exported
    [d]    Carbon Trust Metering Trial: Use (daytype, month, h) to distribute over year
    [p_d]  Carbon Trust Metering Trial: Select day with most enduse and compare how relateds to synthetically generated year

SHAPES Gas
Calculate gas shapes across all sectors:
    [h]   Carbon Trust Metering Trial: averaged daily profily for every month
    [p_h] Carbon Trust Metering Trial: the maximum peak day is selected and daily load shape exported
    [p_d] National Grid (non-residential data based on CWW)
    [d]   National Grid (non-residential data based on CWW) used to assign load for every day (then multiply with h shape)

USED SHAPES FOR ENDUSES

Catering (e,g) (Table 5.05)                         -->   Use electricity shape (disaggregate other fueltypes with this shape)

Computing (e) (Table 5.05)                          -->   Use electricity shape

Cooling and Ventilation (mainly e) (Table 5.05)     -->   Use electricity shapes and distribute other fueltypes with this shape

Hot Water (e,g) (Table 5.05)                        -->   More gas enduse --> Use gas shape across all sectors and distribute also with it elec.

Heating (mainly g) (Table 5.05)                     -->   Use gas load shape accross all sectors and disaggregate other fuels with this load shape

Lighting (e) (Table 5.05)                           -->   Use electricity shapes

Other (e,g) (Table 5.05)                            -->   Use overall electricity and overall gas curve
